                pour over
                200 drinks from one machine.
                In my eight years with Coke, I grew the team from 7 engineers to a team of over 50 people, and their
                talent with
                software, fluid dynamics, hardware, and electronics became the envy of the industry.</p>
              <p>
                We co-created 10 different new dispenser offerings, lowered cost of those dispensers by over 25%,
                improved
                reliability by 10% year over year, and consistently rolled out new drinks to delight our customers.

                I also had the opportunity to travel all over the world, from Bangkok to Rome and to represent a loved
                brand.

                What an amazing experience!

              <p> I could have stayed with Tracker forever, but sometimes life has other plans, and the opportunity to
                design the future of Coke's Freestyle beverage platforms was just too good to pass up.

              <h4>Fluke Biomedical</h4>
              <h5>Director of New Product Development</h5>
              <p>When I joined Fluke, it was a Danaher company, and I was part of the fastest growing division in
                Fluke, Fluke Biomedical.
                This was a time of intense learning for me, as I learned more about how to manage a business from
                the
                Danaher
                Business System training and our day-to-day operations than I had learned to that point.
                Additionally, this was my first foray into the medical device space, with 510(k) pre-market approval
                regulation,
                along with European medical device and machinery directives a central part of our design strategy.
              </p>
              <p>I continued my pattern of partnering with the manufacturing team, made some great friends, and
                created
                more best-in-class products.
              </p>
              <p>This was another role where I could easily have spent years, as the technical cutting-edge culture
                of
                innovation,
                along with the accountability of Danaher, resonated so strongly with my personal beliefs. In the
                end,
                though,
                I had a
                great career opportunity come along, and it fit better with what my family needed at that time. </p>

              <p>When Ingersoll-Rand bought Trane, it opened the door to opportunities across

              <h4>Trane</h4>
              <p>Trane was a fantastic next step in my career. I was leading 60 people to design our flagship
                commercial rooftop air conditioner,
                and I had no direct authority over the team. If it was an engineering challenge, I owned it.
                Manufacturing? I'm the guy.
                Service? Finance? Marketing? It's all my responsibility!
                Fortunately, the whole organization had a common mission and the family-like
                atmosphere helped me build
                influence quickly, resulting in our shipping our first unit two days ahead of schedule. Our biggest
                challenge after that milestone
                was keeping up with demand!
              </p>
              <p>I went on at Trane to become a functional manager, with direct responsibility for all the engineering
                team working on all of our large commercial products.
                We had a regulatory deadline that was a massive challenge for the team, yet that challenge became a
                burning platform and focus, and we were able to get it all
                done in advance of the regulation.
              </p>
              <p>Probably the most memorable time I had at Trane was in a large review meeting with our division
                president, Craig.
                At one point, it was clear that one of the teams
                had sold a customer a piece of equipment that was not meeting the need, and after several iterations
                of trying to retrofit it, Craig asked the team
                what it would take to buy our competitor's unit and install it in place of our unit on the customer's
                roof. When I think about customer obsession,
                that conversation is an anchor point for me, and ended up being foundational in my business beliefs.

                new opportunity to learn. Like Ford, Visteon had a strong philosophy that to design products
                well, partnering with the manufacturing facility was key, and my experience in manufacturing
                shaped how I think about product design to this day.

                Unfortunately, the company was not well-positioned financially, and
                after multiple rounds of watching friends get laid off, I decided to search for a new role, which
                led
                me to a great experience at Trane.

            <h4>Ford Motor Company</h4>
            <p>I learned engineering in school, but I learned how to be an engineer at Ford. The combination of

              quality
              expectations, highly complex products,
              fierce competition, and the resulting pressure on cost taught me efficiency of design. Learning to ask
              if
              every penny I spend on the product
              is something a customer would pay for was a graduate degree in itself.</p>
            <p>Ford also afforded me the opportunity to learn many skills, as I worked in Product Planning, Design
              Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering,
              Strategy, Marketing, Program Management, and even IT. I met some amazing people and made some lifelong
              friendss.

            <p>I ended up paying my way through business school writing expert system software for a professor's side

              I'm grateful that Professor Kolstad gave me this chance, for I developed key skills in both technical

              people management.

            <p>I looked at the world through a new lens, I learned some new skills, earned my MBA, and most
